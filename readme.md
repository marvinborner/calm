-   Strong reduction (reduction inside abstractions) of call-by-need
    lambda calculus
-   Originally intended as reducer of the `bruijn` programming language
-   Useful for proof assistants or as a high-level lambda-term reducer
    of functional programming languages
-   Based on bleeding-edge research results
